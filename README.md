Playing around with the Marvel comics API

I want to play with the Marvel API to build some kind of cool application.

Doco on the Marvel API is here https://developer.marvel.com/documentation/getting_started

What I would like to do
Learn new stuff!
- Play with Feathers
- Play with React/Redux some more
- Build a boilerplate from scratch myself (use Yeoman?)
- Build a wicked UI that displays comic artwork
- Maybe look at d3 around data visualisation of character appearances
